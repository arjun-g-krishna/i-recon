# i Recon

An eye-blink based alert system for paralyzed patients suffering from Locked in Syndrome(LiS). 
Final year project done as part of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University syllabus.

## Introduction

Several neurological disorders including LiS and severe cases of ALS(Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) could cause patients to lose control over all voluntary muscles leaving them paralysed. 
The project puts forward a solution to the inconveniences faced by a paralyzed patient, making use of an alert mechanism to connect the caretaker with the patient.Patients with such conditions need round the clock assistance which is not feasible.Instead patients could call the caretaker when needed through eye blinks.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/arjun-g-krishna/i-recon
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd i-recon
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Replace "key.json" at line 14 in counter.py with the path to your firebase admin credentials json file and replace #### at line 15 with your firebase realtime database URL.

<br> Run the program

```bash
  python3 counter.py
```
