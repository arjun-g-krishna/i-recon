# i Recon

An eye-blink based alert system for paralyzed patients suffering from ALS syndrome. 
Final year project done as part of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University syllabus.

## Introduction

Several neurological disorders could cause patients to lose control over all voluntary muscles leaving them paralysed. 
The project puts forward a solution to the inconveniences faced by a paralyzed patient, making use of an alert mechanism to connect the caretaker with the patient.
It aims to provide round clock assistance with great efficiency.
